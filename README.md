# RedShiftIndex

>//Currently in Early Development Stage

RedShift Index is a python based desktop software which features functions like AstroWIki, Astrophotography, Astrophysics related information, Problem solving on Astrophysics and Astronomy / Mathematical Astronomy. Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to seek to understand the universe and our place in it. RedShift Index helps its users to know about Astrophysics more.

We aim to make a desktop software with legitimate information both in **Bengali** and **English** Language on Astronomical objects, events and news along with a dedicated section for its users to practice problems like AstroOlympiads in order to attract more people into Astrophysics and explore its significance and beauty.
